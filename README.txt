PROJECT TITLE:DOOR AUTOMATION SYSTEM USING SPEECH COMMAND PIN USING ANDROID SMARTPHONE



1)ABOUT THE PROJECT:
BUILT WITH EMBEDDED C LANGUAGE

2)GETTING STARTED :

A)REQUIREMENTS:
ANDROID SMARTPHONE
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION

B)KIT REQUIRMENTS:
BLUETOOTH MODULE
ARDUINO
LPG SENSOR
RELAY 
DC MOTOR

3)WORKING:
In our system, we use the speech recognition Google API to control the lock/unlock of the door using a human voice command. The main advantages of this API are that it can convert Audio speech to text, and that it has a vast database Easy to implement.
Here the  user sends a voice command to the smartphone with its microphone through the interface presented in which converts the speech to text using the speech recognition Google API, then, analyzes this text to interpret the message and then sends the locking command to the door.

4)STEPS:
**********************************************************************************
Pair your Android’s Bluetooth to HC-05 module.
Open the app and connect to HC-05 again.
Your voice controlled home automation system is ready to work.
Touch ‘Speak’ icon on the app, say ‘Door Open’ in front of your smartphone to turn the appliance and it will Display ‘Door Open’.
The DC motor Moving Will Indicate in That the Command has been performed and the result is showed in the board
